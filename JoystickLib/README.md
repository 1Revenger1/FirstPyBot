# JoystickLib

This library has a single class, `JoystickUtils`, which wraps pyfrc's `Joystick` class. The main addition is a "dead-zone" for the position of the joystick.

Method names in JoystickUtils mostly correspond with those in Joystick. Look [here](http://robotpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/wpilib/Joystick.html) for documentation for the original Joystick class.
